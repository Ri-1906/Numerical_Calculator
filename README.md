# Numerical Methods Calculator

This is a Python program that implements various numerical methods for finding roots of equations. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built using the Tkinter library.
The project now uses Tkinter for both the interface and graph display, so you can run it directly with Python without relying on a separate executable.

## _Main Program Demo_

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Sympy library
- Tkinter library (usually included with Python on Windows)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## How to Run

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to start the program:

```python main.py``` or ```python3 main.py```

## Usage

1. Select a numerical method from the dropdown menu.
2. Enter the equation in the "Enter f(x)" field. Use the `^` symbol for exponentiation.
3. Enter the required parameters based on the selected method.
4. Click the "Calculate" button to find the root of the equation.
5. The program will display the root, error, and additional information.
6. Enable "Open Graph Window" if you want a Tkinter-based graph view of the selected method.

## Numerical Methods

The program supports the following numerical methods:

- Bisection
- False Position
- Secant
- Newton-Raphson
- Simple Fixed-Point Iteration

Each method has different requirements for input parameters. Make sure to fill in the appropriate fields based on the selected method.
